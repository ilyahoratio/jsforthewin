# Simple Node Message Encryptor Decryptor
Encrypt / decrypt your messages in node with aes-256-ctr encryption.

# About 
Privacy is everything, man. This code doesn't guarantee 100% unbreakable encryption, what with quantum computers and what not. But still, it's a nice tool to have to fool around a bit.

# Usage
If you are using it for the first time ever, no worries. The program explains everything in the terminal.

1) Run the program via Node

```
node crypty.js
```

2) Select if you would like to encrypt a decrypt a message

```
Would you like to encrypt a message or decrypt a message?
1 Encrypt
2 Decrypt

Enter 1 or 2:

```
etc... the rest is easy and will be explained in the terminal


__Important note:__ 
Please follow the instructions below closely. Meaning, read everything carefully. 

# PS 
I am no expert at encrypting stuff, it's just what I managed to create with what little knowledge I have. For fun and giggles. Should you notice that something is fataly off (terminology or things of that nature), I will be glad to gain new knowledge from you.
