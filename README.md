# JS for the win!

The things that can be done with coding...

As I like French language in all its shapes and forms, my little programs have to do with helping me automate some aspects of learning French.

Apart from French, you may well find here other no less interesting programs created by me.

Should something change as far as the scope of my js programs, this description will be duly tweaked.
